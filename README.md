Installation

git clone https://github.com/Sai-Teja86/Auto-Nmap.git
cd Auto-Nmap

Usage

1. python3 auto-nmap.py

2. You will find the below options

	üìú Select a target input method:
      		1. Single IP/Host	-	for single ip/host
		2. Target file		-	for multiple ip's. When prompted to enter the path of target file, just enter "targets.txt". You should priorly enter all ip's/hostsin the text file.

3. You will be prompted to choose an option from the lsit of vulnerabilities. Just enter the nuber and hit enter

4. After the scan is completed, you will be prompted to choose to continue or exit
     
	What would you like to do next?
      		1. Continue	-	To test for another vulnerability
   		2. Exit		-	To Exit
5. Once exit, you can find all the output in a file

	üìù Final results saved in 'nmap_scan_results.txt'
	üëã Exiting... Have a secure day!
